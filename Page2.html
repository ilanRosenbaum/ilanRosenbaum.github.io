Similarly to how soma is used in <i>Brave New World</i> computers of today are used to escape the real world. Soma is used to escaping reality in a much more obvious and pronounced way then phones and computers are, but computers and phones are used to escape conversations and can be used as social crutches the same way soma is in <i>Brave New World</i>. The transistor was one of if not the most important part of the modern computer chip which is needed in all our phones and computers. So the transistor led to the creation of modern electronics something that we spend a massive amount of time on daily instead of spending time in the “real world”.
