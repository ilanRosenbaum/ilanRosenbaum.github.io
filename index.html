    <h1> How have Transistors Effected History and Life Today </h1>

    <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
      The transistor has had a massive effect throughout modern history and on how we live today. When the transistor was invented in 1947 it was very similar to transistors today with one massive difference, they were much larger. Even in there relatively large state at the time, it was a massive improvement on vacuum tubes. For reference, the most powerful computer at the time was the ENIAC witch had 18,000 vacuum tubes in it and took up about 1,800 feet of space. The invention of the transistor emidietly made computers smaller and more powerful even in there relatively large state in the 1940s-50s. So over time as transistors got smaller, they enabled the inventions of many technologies we use today. One of the first things that was possible because of transistors was the home computer which was first released in the 1970s. This is because during the 70s transistor counts on microchips started to skyrocket going from 2,300 in 1971 up to 68,000 by 1979. As time went on transistors got smaller and smaller enabling computers to have over 100,000 transistors by 1984 and over a million by 1989. We needed transistors to get smaller because the more transistors there are in a computer the more powerful the computer is so as transistor counts skyrocketed so did the complexity of what computers could do. Transistors enabled the creation of the smart cell phones we use every day. Phones are just small computers and a single vacuum tube equivalent to one transistor is bigger than most phones of today. This leads to today were one Intel i7 chip has 3.2 billion transistors and the apple A11 chip has over 3 billion in less than 4 square inches. In this age of technology, none of it would be possible without transistors. In one day almost everything we use needs transistors to function, to start out phones. In my generation, almost everyone uses there phones for multiple hours a day and without transistors, all of our phones would just be extremely expensive bricks. Computers run on central processing units and graphics processing units witch both run on transistors. Basically, laptops, home computers, and supercomputers all need modern transistors to function. Most of the largest companies today couldn’t exist without transistors such as Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. All Apple and Microsoft products run on transistors and Google couldn’t exist because the internet wouldn’t exist without transistors even and if it did nobody would be able to use it because nobody would have computers or phones which is why Amazon couldn’t exist. Amazon is an online marketplace so obviously without the internet it can’t work. Everything from cars to TVs needs transistors to function.  Overall everyone in my generation's lives would be entirely different without transistors to a point I can't even describe because without transistors there would be no advanced electronics. I don't know what my life would be like without electronics, but I can say with confidence our lives would look nothing like they do today.
