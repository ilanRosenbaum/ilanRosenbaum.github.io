<p style="text-indent: 5em;">
Transistors serve society in an extremely positive way. They helped create many hundreds of thousands of jobs and even new industries. I think Huxley would have liked transistors because they do help tons of people and improve everyone's quality of life and also helped connect many more people. They created the computer industry as well as many others but most importantly they changed how we live today. Transistors in 20 years will look completely different then they do now because as of now it's almost impossible to make transistors get smaller. This is because transistors are almost becoming microscopic. So now transistors canâ€™t really get much smaller. In response, quantum transistors known as Qubits are being created. These can be both a 0 and a 1 at the same time meaning that instead of 4 bits meaning 1 thing 4 Qubits mean 16 things. This is already being invented but it's a long way out from being fully usable.
