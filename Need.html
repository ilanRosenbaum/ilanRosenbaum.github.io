The transistor was invented as a much-needed replacement for the vacuum tube. They were used as signal amplifiers as well as switches. They didn’t do anything that vacuum tubes didn’t but they are smaller, create less heat, and are much cheaper. It still meets this need and it really exceeded it, they went from the massive clunky fragile vacuum tube to the almost microscopic and dirt cheap transistors of today. It meets and exceeds its original purpose as the vacuum tube is entirely obsolete.
